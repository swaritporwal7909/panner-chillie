Tips
The very first rule for making restaurant-style Chilli Paneer is that you must shallow fry the cottage cheese or paneer.
Make sure you donâ€™t over fry the paneer, as it can make it hard and chewy, while it should be soft and melt-in-the-mouth.
Before frying the paneer, you can dip it in the batter of rice-corn flour batter. It will make the paneer crunchy and delicious.
For making Chilli Paneer, use sesame oil for an authentic Chinese flavour.
Cook all the veggies on high heat to keep them crunchy.
